NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::DualBuilders - Allows use of Module::Build and
    ExtUtils::MakeMaker in a dzil dist

VERSION
      This document describes v1.001 of Dist::Zilla::Plugin::DualBuilders - released December 15, 2010 as part of Dist-Zilla-Plugin-DualBuilders.

DESCRIPTION
    This plugin allows you to specify ModuleBuild and MakeMaker in your
    Dist::Zilla dist.ini and select only one as your prereq. Normally, if
    this plugin is not loaded you will end up with both in your prereq list
    and this is obviously not what you want! Also, this will block both
    builders from running the testsuite twice.

            # In your dist.ini:
            [ModuleBuild]
            [MakeMaker] ; or [MakeMaker::Awesome], will work too :)
            [DualBuilders] ; needs to be specified *AFTER* the builders

ATTRIBUTES
  prefer
    Sets your preferred builder. This builder will be the one added to the
    prereqs. Valid options are: "make" or "build".

    The default is: build

  block_test
    This is a boolean value determining if we will block both testers from
    running the testsuite. If you have both builders loaded, you will run
    the testsuite twice! If you want this behavior, please set this value to
    false.

    The default is: true
