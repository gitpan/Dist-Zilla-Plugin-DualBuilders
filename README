NAME

    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::DualBuilders - (DEPRECATED) Allows use of
    Module::Build and ExtUtils::MakeMaker in a dzil dist

VERSION

      This document describes v1.002 of Dist::Zilla::Plugin::DualBuilders - released October 28, 2014 as part of Dist-Zilla-Plugin-DualBuilders.

DESCRIPTION

    ***DEPRECATED***

    While this plugin still works, it did not work cleanly for everyone and
    it's preferred for you to pick one builder and stick with it! The
    latest toolchain updates have ensured that modern Perls are able to
    handle either builder. Therefore there is no longer the need to include
    both Build.PL and Makefile.PL in the dist. If you want to provide
    support for older Perls, please use
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::MakeMaker::Fallback.

 OLD POD

    This plugin allows you to specify ModuleBuild and MakeMaker in your
    Dist::Zilla dist.ini and select only one as your prereq. Normally, if
    this plugin is not loaded you will end up with both in your prereq list
    and this is obviously not what you want! Also, this will block both
    builders from running the testsuite twice.

            # In your dist.ini:
            [ModuleBuild]
            [MakeMaker] ; or [MakeMaker::Awesome], will work too :)
            [DualBuilders] ; needs to be specified *AFTER* the builders

ATTRIBUTES

 prefer

    Sets your preferred builder. This builder will be the one added to the
    prereqs. Valid options are: "make" or "build".

    The default is: build

 block_test

    This is a boolean value determining if we will block both testers from
    running the testsuite. If you have both builders loaded, you will run
    the testsuite twice! If you want this behavior, please set this value
    to false.

    The default is: true
