NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::DualBuilders - Allows use of Module::Build and
    ExtUtils::MakeMaker in a dzil dist

DESCRIPTION
    This plugin allows you to specify ModuleBuild and MakeMaker in your
    Dist::Zilla dist.ini and select only one as your prereq. Normally, if
    this plugin is not loaded you will end up with both in your prereq list
    and this is obviously not what you want!

            # In your dist.ini:
            [ModuleBuild]
            [MakeMaker] ; or [MakeMaker::Awesome], will work too :)
            [DualBuilders] ; needs to be specified *AFTER* the builders

    This plugin accepts the following options:

    *   prefer

        Sets your preferred builder. This builder will be the one added to
        the prereqs. Valid options are: "make" or "build".

        The default is: build
